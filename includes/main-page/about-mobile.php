				<span>Giving the little kids, AND the BIGGER kids :) a fun, family-friendly environment, Appalachian Speedway & MX Park will open its doors on Friday July 3rd and Saturday July 4th, with events taking place every weekend thereafter through the summer and fall seasons.
Located on reclaimed mine property, just outside of Inez, KY in Martin county, we have plenty of room, wildlife and picturesque scenery (especially the sunsets).  Bring the family, stay the night, and most of all- make yourself at home!  We'll show you some good ole' southern hospitality.
Everyone's safety is our main priority.  We will have EMT's/medically trained personnel on hand, along with security staff and courteous park representatives to assist you in any way they can. Concessions and restrooms on site.  Last but certainly not least:  NO drugs, NO alcohol allowed on premises.  Thank you for understanding.</span>
